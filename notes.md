# Notes

## TODO

* (Meat & 'taters) Vectorization algorithm! At first use someone else's and improve and fix later

* Define a spec for animated SVGs that is as smart as possible, allowing for the least possible data to be stored
  this would require us to implement our own renderer (yikes!) that conforms to the spec
  
* Compress the SVG file as much as possible by using simple things like minification but maybe later using
  actual compression algorithms like MPEG and shit

## Ideas

* Find some test clips from cartoons, I think a nice mix of time period and art styles would be nice

* Figure out a decent way to quantitatively measure results (quality and compression)
